6.1.Set the register T0CON value such a way that bit TMR0ON and PSA bit are set (1), without disturbing the other bits.
Algorithm:
1.Acess & instilize the Registers bits.
2.TMR0ON and PSA bit are set 1 without disturbing other bits.
3.By using OR with 1 you have to set above bits 
4.Note down the result as num bits.



6.2.Find out the value of T0PS2, T0PS1, T0PS0 bits in T0CON register if the value of the register is 0xF3
1.Acess & instilize the Registers bits.
2.TCON registers set to 0xF3
3.oxF3 register rightshift with how many iterations you want and aftyer that & with one 
4.Note down  the values of TOPS2,TOPS1,TOPS0
