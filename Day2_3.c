/*It was Raj's first day at school. His teacher asked the students to meet
 every other student in the class and to introduce themselves.
 The teacher asked them to give handshakes when they meet each other.
 If there are ‘n’ number of students in the class then find the total number
 of handshakes made by the students. */
